Smith et al., (submitted), Physical controls on carbonate intraclasts: 
an analog for ancient flat pebbles from Great Salt Lake, Utah

The wind_wave script reads and processes wind data from the Mesowest
database. Note that the data must be saved as a .csv with only one 
row of headers (i.e., secondary rows such as units omitted). 

The energy_balance script makes simple calculations of energy change
due to cementation and bioturbation in the upper 2 cenitmeters of the
sediment column.
